## ⚙️ Background

For our class project, we are using a dataset from the Los Angeles City Controller's office to gain insights into urban development and financial trends. We had to create three analytical questions to gain a better understanding of data analysis and management. Our goal is to leverage this project to enhance our skills in statistical analysis and make meaningful contributions to the field of urban planning.


## 📊 Data

This dataset contains 700,145 records and 62 variables, offering a comprehensive view of financial transactions within the city. It is available on their open data portal and is well-suited for dimensional modeling and analytical analysis due to its systematic framework.
