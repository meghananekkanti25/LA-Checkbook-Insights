# üìã LA-Checkbook-Insights

## ‚öôÔ∏è Background
For our class project, we are using a dataset from the Los Angeles City Controller's office to gain insights into urban development and financial trends. We had to act as consultants for the Controller's office, put ourselves in their shoes, and create three analytical questions to gain a better understanding of data analysis and management. Our goal is to leverage this project to enhance our skills in statistical analysis and make meaningful contributions to the field of urban planning.


## üìä Data
This dataset contains 700,145 records and 62 variables, providing a comprehensive foundation for analysis. This organization allows researchers to efficiently explore and interpret data, gaining granular insights into resource allocation within the City of Los Angeles. By examining expenditures, vendors, departments, and fund types, users can uncover valuable patterns and trends in financial resource distribution, facilitating informed decision-making processes.

Data source:

You can find the data here: https://controllerdata.lacity.org/api/views/mkec-7zmd/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD&api_foundry=true.

You can find the data dictionary and more information about each field here: https://controllerdata.lacity.org/Purchasing/2020-Checkbook-Data/mkec-7zmd.


## üèÅ Getting Started
Start by setting up the appropriate environment to run a Jupyter Notebook file to ensure you have the proper versions of the required libraries. Once that is done, ensure you have PostgreSQL installed and running. You can then download the data and .ipynb file and hit "Run All" on the notebook.


## üß© Dimensional Modelling
We want to create a schema to get a logical understanding and structure for the database by defining tables, columns, and their relationships.

First we start from this schema:

We will eventually build a dimensional schema like this:

We then create the database by define the tables and their relationships using sql functions. 

‚ùóÔ∏èMake sure that the number of records of the final fact (checkbook in this case) match the number of records in the original data after data cleaning.


## üå† Data Analysis and Visualization
Using Pandas and Matplotlib, we created visualizations to better understand the data to explain and effectively answer the questions.
