# üìã LA-Checkbook-Insights

## ‚öôÔ∏è Background

For our class project, we are using a dataset from the Los Angeles City Controller's office to gain insights into urban development and financial trends. We had to act as consultants for the Controller's office, put ourselves in their shoes, and create three analytical questions to gain a better understanding of data analysis and management. Our goal is to leverage this project to enhance our skills in statistical analysis and make meaningful contributions to the field of urban planning.
